This is a simple express app for 2 idiots, 1 keyboard that is equipped with minimal routes and a websocket to enable communication. I did not spend more than a day coding on this and you can clearly see that in the code.

## Getting Started

To, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the result.
