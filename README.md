# 2 Idiots 1 Keyboard (2i1k) 👨‍💻+👨‍💻+⌨️

> The site is live on [2i1k.fun](https://www.2i1k.fun)!!!

This is a fun side-project that I unknowingly side-tracked after watching a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTOEWqjeHI) by [ThePrimeTime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen). The idea is very simple, you solve LeetCode questions with your friend, taking control of the editor alternatively. The control switches when one user enters a whitespace or a new line.

This project is implemented using a simple express server and NextJS client (w/shadcn ui). All the communication is done through web sockets with the Socket.io library. 


## Note: 

- There is still some work to be done to let the users  submit the code that they type to LeetCode, but for now, I think this is it. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you feel something is wrong/could have been better. Thanks!
- Good luck trying to understand my spaghetti code tho 😉
