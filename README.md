# 2 Idiots 1 Keyboard (2i1k)

This is a fun side-project that I unknowingly side-tracked after watching a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTOEWqjeHI) by [ThePrimeTime](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen). The idea is very simple, you solve LeetCode questions with your friend, taking control of the editor alternatively. The control switches when one user enters a whitespace or a new line.

This project is implemented using a simple express server and NextJS client (w/shadcn ui). All the communication is done through web sockets with the Socket.io library. 


# Note: 

**This project is still a work in progress!**
sigh! I really hope this gets done one day.
